              <h3>The drive to code</h3>
              When working as a Growth Hacker (first at a startup then at an
              agency) I came across the world of coding. Tracking, AB Testing,
              automation & data were all involved.I found out that at some point
              I was counting down the hours doing online marketing. It was then
              that I decided to make the switch. I loved the solving problems
              aspect, the creativity and quickly found out that I would lose
              track of time while doing programming. I would get into flow, that
              was a really strong sign for me to dive in even deeper and for the
              past 1.5 years I taught myself to code, almost every day, little
              by little.

              <h3>What I believe in</h3>I believe that virtually anyone can
              learn any skill, as long as they put in the effort & the
              discipline. The question is whether you like it or not. If you
              want something done, then you should just do it. One of the most
              valuable lessons was from an ex-collegue of mine. He had this huge
              undertaking he had to do, his advise on how to start? "Just
              Start". Build, Measure, Learn. Learn from everything, priortize
              what is important to you (both in life and in work) and get it
              done.

                I would proudly call myself a bit of a nerd, things such as Star
