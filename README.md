# Getting Started with the Personal Website

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). You can freely git clone this code and run it yourself if you want to.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

This project was made in order to showcase who I am and what I can offer, it is also just a very good project to practice development.

Its tech stack is simple so far:
- HTML, CSS & React and its deployed via Heroku
- react-router is used in order to help out with the routing

Its made with React not neccesarily because its the correct tool for it, but rather for me to practice with it, as for now there is not a lot of state management that takes place but it may change in the future.

Folder Structure:

Most of the ful web pages are under "Screens", most of the components that go in them go in "Components"
I have elected to seperate the CSS used as well in ScreensCSS as well as componentCss. I may revise this later in order to create a clearer resuable CSS flow.

Modules:
- I have chosen to make some of the code work in modules employing react and arrays and objects. This makes it flexible, resuable and scaleable and overall more user friendly to work with in the long run.


Work that needs to be done:
- Add a Mobile Friendly Version
- Update the UX design to go from a MVP version to a higher level
- Add a backend and add a Blog Section
- Possibly add a Leave a Message ability with automated response through the mail.

Have fun with it!
